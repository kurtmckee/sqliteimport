.. _changelog-0.5.0:

0.5.0 - 2025-02-15
==================

Python support
--------------

*   Support PyPy 3.11.

Added
-----

*   Add initial support for bundling and loading Python bytecode (``.pyc`` files).

    Performance testing on Linux shows that loading from sqlite is now twice as fast.

    The implementation currently binds the sqlite database
    to the Python version used to bundle it.

Documentation
-------------

*   Add the changelog and a colophon to the documentation.

*   Configure ReadtheDocs to use the ``dirhtml`` builder.

*   Update the links shown on PyPI.

Development
-----------

*   Fix test project regeneration, which broke when Poetry 2 was released.

    *   Migrate from Poetry to ``build`` to build the test project wheels.
    *   Pin the regeneration tool dependencies.
    *   Update the test projects' ``pyproject.toml`` files to use PEP 621 metadata keys.

*   Add a script to log performance comparisons across multiple importers,
    including source and bytecode files when imported from the filesystem,
    from sqlite, and from zip files with varying compression levels.

.. _changelog-0.4.0:

0.4.0 - 2025-02-06
==================

Added
-----

*   Auto-load files on the Python path that end with ``.sqlite3``.

Fixed
-----

*   Pin the build system requirement to ``poetry-core`` v2.

Documentation
-------------

*   Document compatible flake8 and isort configurations.

.. _changelog-0.3.0:

0.3.0 - 2025-01-29
==================

Python support
--------------

*   Test against Python 3.14 pre-releases.
*   Drop Python 3.8 support.
*   Drop PyPy 3.9 support.

Added
-----

*   Add a database index to improve import performance.
*   Support calls to ``importlib.metadata.version()``.
*   Partially support accessing resources in packages.
*   Support binary files (like non-UTF-8 Python modules) and resources.

Fixed
-----

*   Fix a bug in the bundling code that allowed non-Python files to be importable.

    Previously, a package containing a PEP 561 ``py.typed`` file
    would have an importable submodule named ``{package}.py``.

*   Fix a bug that prevented databases bundled on Windows from finding package metadata.

Changed
-------

*   Introduce a data access object to manage database interactions.
*   Create a ``sqliteimport`` table to store metadata about the database.
*   Bundle ``.dist-info/`` metadata directories into databases.

Documentation
-------------

*   Use an absolute URL to the banner in the README.

    This helps ensure that PyPI releases will render the README consistently.

Development
-----------

*   Test that Unicode filenames can be imported.
*   Add a script to generate a large Python package for performance testing.
*   Resolve a ``ResourceWarning`` in the test suite on Python 3.13.
*   Add CI testing.
*   Create a framework for testing bundling and importing.
*   Migrate to PEP 621 metadata in ``pyproject.toml``.
*   Create release PRs via a reusable workflow.

.. _changelog-0.2.0:

0.2.0 - 2024-05-23
==================

Added
-----

*   Add a ``cli`` extra.
*   Add a CLI command, ``sqliteimport bundle``, to assist with database generation.

.. _changelog-0.1.0:

0.1.0 - 2024-05-22
==================

Initial release
---------------

*   Support loading Python source code from a sqlite database.
