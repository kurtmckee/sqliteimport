Development
-----------

*   Fix test project regeneration, which broke when Poetry 2 was released.

    *   Migrate from Poetry to ``build`` to build the test project wheels.
    *   Pin the regeneration tool dependencies.
    *   Update the test projects' ``pyproject.toml`` files to use PEP 621 metadata keys.
